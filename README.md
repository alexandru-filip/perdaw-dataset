# The PERDAW Dataset v.1.0

The Perdaw Dataset, short for "Plan, and Elevation Representations of Doors And Windows," is a comprehensive dataset designed to facilitate research and development in the field of architectural element recognition and classification. This dataset comprises plan and elevation views of various doors and windows, providing rich and detailed representations suitable for machine learning tasks, particularly in the domain of computer vision.

## Dataset Content and Structure

## Development Process

## Publications
"Towards Digitisation of Technical Drawings in Architecture: Evaluation of CNN Classification on the Perdaw Dataset" is currently under review for the [Engineering Applications of Neural Networks](https://eannconf.org) which compares the performance of ResNet50, MobileNet V2 and Inception V3 on the PERDAW dataset splits (which were described under [Dataset Content and Structure](#dataset-content-and-structure)).
